excerpt: 'Epileptiform activity is associated with worse patient outcomes, including increased risk of disability and death. However, the effect of epileptiform activity on neurological outcome is confounded by the feedback between treatment with antiseizure medications and epileptiform activity burden. We aimed to quantify the heterogeneous effects of epileptiform activity with an interpretabile, causal inference approach.'
