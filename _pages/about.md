Hello! My name is Kentaro Hoffman (feel free to pronounce this in whatever way you like! I have a list of unique pronunciations of my name. As of 2024, it's about 10 long). My Ph.D. advisor was Kai Zhang and Cynthia Rudin at UNC Chapel Hill and I am currently a Postdoc at the University of Washington working with Dr. Tyler McCormick. 

I am currently interesting in how best us statisticians can incorporate our methods in a world where increasing amounts of data is becoming AI-generated. To this end, I am very excited about a paradigm known as Inference on Predicted Algorithms [IPA](https://github.com/awanafiaz/IPD) which allows one to combine ground truth and AI-generated labels to improve the quality of inference while minimizing data collection costs, particularly in public health surveys.

If you find anything here of interest, please feel free to reach out!
